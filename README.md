Open source Standardized SQL Naming Convention Abbreviations

This repository contains a list of words and their abbreviations for all developers to use so that future developers working on the database have a reference guide. This is an attempt to standardized the abbreviations in databases as well as languages. Developers like efficeincy and the less characters the better. Please feel free to contibute and as this list progresses hopefully more people will adopt these naming conventions and we can start to create a standardized library. ( App that searches for words will follow )
